- FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES: White background chats are Match chats and purple background chats are Ship chats.

Maybe use this: https://medium.com/@elye.project/simplest-chat-app-using-firestore-50-lines-of-code-66dc8e5e4b50 as a starting point?

- [ ] Match chat (same as Ship chat but with different top bar which shows mutual friends:
![match chat top bar inspired by messenger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41013746/42921729-3ab078c6-8b15-11e8-9b39-2789ad490f79.png)
 )
- Upon tapping mutual friends, opens list of mini profile pictures and names of mutual friends. Tapping on a mutual friend opens up a Ship chat page. SAME Ship Chat page for both consulter and consultee.

- At the top of the mutual friends list is a search function like in the Crush function. You can also email people whom you'd like to ask for consultation.


- [ ] Ship chat
- TOP BAR: back button on far left, profile pic, first name (clickable to see full profile). (mockup here:

)
- TOP BAR: Mini Ship logo in the middle. Upon tapping mini Ship logo, a pop-up with Ship or Sink slider appears. Slide up to Ship the couple. Slide down to sink the couple. Slider also appears immediately upon FIRST opening the chat only.
- If couple Shipped/Sunk, a message is sent to both consulter and consultee that says they have been shipped/sunk. (BEYOND MVP, MAY BE AN IDEA TO HAVE A WHIMSICAL ANIMATION AND MAYBE WAYS TO EXPRESS-SUPERSHIPPING/SINKING). This is effectively a copy of Messenger's emojis/stickers.
- (REMOVE 4.)
- Simple messaging (at least for MVP)
- MMS bar: identical to that in FB messenger. DO NOT INCLUDE IN MVP.
- Text field: to send a message. (ADD A SEND BUTTON).


- [ ] Message menu
- Standard options as in Facebook Messenger. (i.e. mute, **block**, **report** (for MVP). Beyond MVP, nicknames, search in conversation, change colour, etc)
