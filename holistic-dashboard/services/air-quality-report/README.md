# air-quality-report
This service gathers data on the most populated cities and measures it over time. It gives dashboard users access to:

## Roadmap _(in progress)_
- [ ] time triggered cloud function (cron job)
- [ ] gather data on all all the most populated cities and store it in firebase
- [ ] provide a component for the UI to display data for a particular area
- [ ] provide overall comparisons between cities and other UI components

## Most populated cities source
The City Mayors Foundation seems like a reasonably trustworthy source.

Here's the link to the data (2018):
* http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-population-125.html

It's used in this article and that's how I found it:
* https://ceoworld.biz/2018/07/16/these-are-the-worlds-top-300-most-populous-cities-2018/


## User stories
* User can view and search air quality of major cities.
* User can view air quality of their city (they set it or by their location) and, perhaps, its peak and clearest hours etc.
* User perhaps could view a graph of their city pollution over time.
