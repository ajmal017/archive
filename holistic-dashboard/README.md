# Holistic Dashboard
A project to give access to the information we need to empower ourselves in today's rapidly evolving world.

## Development
The following rules must be followed **at all times** when developing for this project:
- all services will be thoroughly documents
- code style as defined in the [global linting config](#Todo: add eslint settings) will be followed
- all code will be written onto feature branches and PRs created before merging into the master branch.

## Architecture
Each service is stored in it's own folder in the [`/services`](/services) folder. This folder will have it's own documentation relevant to the worker.

## User Interface _(in progress)_
The main user interface can be found in the ['/dashboard-ui`](/dashboard-ui) folder.

## Services
- [air-quality-report](/services/air-quality-report) _(in progress)_
